                                        Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they 
                                        believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the city 
                                        of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city center by foot 
                                        surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in 
                                        time to the “glory that was Rome”.

                                        Rome is a city of contrasts. From the Vatican City, the seat of the Roman 
                                        Catholic Church to the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum, 
                                        Rome is a city that is proud of its ancient glorious heritage. The city is 
                                        also proud of its modern and vibrant living with open-air markets, 
                                        stunning artistic fountains, and great food.

                                        Rome is a city of romance, a city of history, and a city of culture. It is 
                                        an enchanting place to visit and is a truly unforgettable city to visit. 
                                        Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and 
                                        Remus — twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war 
                                        god — reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a 
                                        little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are 
                                        absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome.

                                    <h4>Why visit Rome?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        With its unparalleled history, Rome is the third most visited city in Europe 
                                        and the fourteenth worldwide. It attracts visitors from all over the world who 
                                        are impatient to discover the city’s impressive monuments and archaeological 
                                        sites; not to mention its renowned cuisine and its lively atmosphere.

                                        When exploring the Colosseum, visitors will easily imagine how the gladiators 
                                        fought for their lives in the arena, cheered by the crowd. In the Circus Maximus, 
                                        travelers will picture the chariots crashing into each other in order to be first 
                                        in the race, and in the Roman Forum visualize what the Roman public life was like.

                                                The Colosseum is the main symbol of Rome. It's an imposing construction that, 
                                                with almost 2,000 years of history, will bring you back in time to discover the
                                                way of life in the Roman Empire.

                                                The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian
                                                and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, 
                                                the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheater, measuring 188 meters in length, 
                                                156 meters in width, and 57 meters in height.

                                                During the Roman Empire and under the motto of "Bread and Circuses" the Roman Colosseum 
                                                (known then as Flavian Amphitheatre) allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles. 
                                                The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles, and gladiator 
                                                fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated
                                                in the 6th century.

                                                Since the 6th century, the Colosseum has suffered lootings, earthquakes, and even bombings during World 
                                                War Two. Demonstrating a great survival instinct, the Colosseum was used for decades as a storehouse, 
                                                church, cemetery, and even a castle for nobility.

                                                The Pantheon of Agrippa, also known as the Roman Pantheon, is one of the architectural 
                                                masterpieces of the Italian capital. It is the best preserved building from ancient Rome.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The construction of the current Pantheon was carried out during the reign of Hadrian, in 
                                                the year 126 A.D. The name of Agrippa comes from the place in which the current building 
                                                is built, which was previously occupied by the Pantheon of Agrippa, built in the year 27 
                                                B.C and that was destroyed in a fire in the year 80 A.D.
                                                <br><br>
                                                At the beginning of the 7th century the building was donated to the Pope Boniface IV, who 
                                                transformed it into a church, in which function it currently finds itself in a perfect state 
                                                of preservation.

                                                The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: 
                                                the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres. The 
                                                dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's Basilica. At its 
                                                top, a 9 meter diameter opening allows natural light to illuminate the entire building.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The rectangular facade that hides the enormous dome is comprised of 16 granite columns 
                                                which are each 14 meters in height, on which the following inscription can be seen: 
                                                "M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIVM.FECIT", which means "Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built 
                                                this temple when he was a Consul."

                                                of art works are found. The best-known person who can be found buried in the Pantheon 
                                                is without doubt the painter and Renaissance architect Raphael.

                                                The Roman Forum was where religious and public life in ancient Rome took place. 
                                                The Forum is, along with the Colosseum, the greatest sign of the splendor of the 
                                                Roman Empire that can be seen today.
                                                <br><br>
                                                After the fall of the Empire, the Roman Forum was forgotten and little by little 
                                                it was buried under the earth. Although in the 16th century, the existence and 
                                                location of the Forum were already known, it was not until the 20th century that 
                                                excavations were carried out.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Interestingly, the place where the Forum was built was originally a marshy area. 
                                                In the 6th century B.C., the area was drained by means of the Cloaca Maxima, one 
                                                of the first sewer systems in the world.

                                                Visiting Rome without walking around the Forum is like going to Paris without seeing 
                                                the Eiffel Tower. As you travel along the Via Sacra, close your eyes and imagine it 
                                                as it was more than 20 centuries ago, when Julius Caesar walked there.

                                                The best way to skip the line and get to know the Forum in detail is to take a guided 
                                                tour. We'll visit three of the main monuments in the city, the Colosseum, Roman Forum, 
                                                and Palatine Hill, skipping the line, and all with an expert guide.

                                                If you prefer to discover it on your own, we recommend that you head first thing in the 
                                                morning, as this is when people head to visit the Vatican. You can also skip the lines

                                                Vatican City (Città del Vaticano in Italian) is an independent city-state located 
                                                in the heart of Rome, ruled by the Pope (Bishop of Rome). It is the centre of 
                                                authority over the Roman Catholic Church.

                                                The Vatican is the smallest state in Europe. It has a total area of 0,44 km² and 
                                                inside its wall live approximately 1000 people.

                                                gardens. The palace is open to the public, but visitors have to book in advance.

                                                The Vatican City was declared independent from the rest of Italy on 11 February 
                                                1929, with the signing of the Lateran Treaty between Pope Pius XI and Mussolini.

                                                The catacombs are subterranean passageways that were used as place of 
                                                burial for a number of centuries. The burials of Jewish, pagan and early 
                                                Christian Roman citizens in the catacombs began in the second century and 
                                                ended in the fifth century.

                                                The word catacomb, which means "next to the quarry", comes from the fact 
                                                that the first excavations to be used as a place of burial were carried 
                                                out in the outskirts of Rome, next to the site of a quarry.

                                            <h4>The reason for the catacombs</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                The Christians did not agree with the pagan custom of burning the bodies 
                                                of their dead, for which reason to solve problems created from a lack of 
                                                space and the high price of land they decided to create these vast underground 
                                                cemeteries.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The catacombs possess a huge number of subterranean passageways that form 
                                                real labyrinths that are several kilometres long, along which rows of 
                                                rectangular niches were dug out.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The corpses were wrapped in a sheet and placed in the niches, which were 
                                                then covered with gravestones made of marble or, more commonly, baked 
                                                clay. Subsequently, the name of the deceased was carved on the cover 
                                                accompanied by a Christian symbol.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Roman law at the time prohibited the burial of the deceased in the interior 
                                                of the city, for which reason all of the catacombs were located outside 
                                                of the walls. These separated and hidden places below ground constituted 
                                                the perfect refuge in which the Christians could bury their own, freely 
                                                using Christian symbols.

                                            <p>
                                                On signing the Edict of Milan in the year 313, the persecution of Christians 
                                                ceased, and they could begin to build churches and acquire land without fear 
                                                of confiscation. In spite of this they continued to use the catacombs as 
                                                cemeteries until the 5th century.
                                                <br><br>
                                                During the barbarian invasion of Italy in the 8th century many catacombs 
                                                suffered continuous lootings, for which reason the Popes caused the still 
                                                remaining relics to be transferred to the city's churches. After these 
                                                transfers, some catacombs were abandoned completely and forgotten for centuries.

                                                of those buried many centuries ago can be seen. It is fascinating to travel 
                                                through the dark and damp passageways, where you can see, in addition to the 
                                                niches, some inscriptions with the names of the people that once occupied them.

                                                Due to the high infant mortality at that time, you can see a large quantity 
                                                of spaces prepared for these children, alongside some larger graves in which 
                                                the whole family was buried.

                                                During the visit, a guide who is specialized in the topic gives the visitors 
                                                several interesting facts relating to the catacombs and the period in which 
                                                they were operating. The guided tours are in Spanish and are included in the
