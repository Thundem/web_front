                Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they 
                believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the city 
                of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city center by foot 
                surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in 
                time to the “glory that was Rome”.

                Rome is a city of contrasts. From the Vatican City, the seat of the Roman 
                Catholic Church to the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum, 
                Rome is a city that is proud of its ancient glorious heritage. The city is 
                also proud of its modern and vibrant living with open-air markets, 
                stunning artistic fountains, and great food.
            </p>

                Rome is a city of romance, a city of history, and a city of culture. It is 
                an enchanting place to visit and is a truly unforgettable city to visit. 
                Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and 
                Remus — twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war 
                god — reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a 
                little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are 
                absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome.

                                                The Colosseum is the main symbol of Rome. It's an imposing construction that, 
                                                with almost 2,000 years of history, will bring you back in time to discover the
                                                way of life in the Roman Empire.

                                                The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian
                                                and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, 
                                                the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheater, measuring 188 meters in length, 
                                                156 meters in width, and 57 meters in height.

                                                During the Roman Empire and under the motto of "Bread and Circuses" the Roman Colosseum 
                                                (known then as Flavian Amphitheatre) allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles. 
                                                The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles, and gladiator 
                                                fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated
                                                in the 6th century.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Since the 6th century, the Colosseum has suffered lootings, earthquakes, and even bombings during World 
                                                War Two. Demonstrating a great survival instinct, the Colosseum was used for decades as a storehouse, 
                                                church, cemetery, and even a castle for nobility.

                                                    lives of more than 2,000 gladiators.

                                                The Pantheon of Agrippa, also known as the Roman Pantheon, is one of the architectural 
                                                masterpieces of the Italian capital. It is the best preserved building from ancient Rome.

                                                The construction of the current Pantheon was carried out during the reign of Hadrian, in 
                                                the year 126 A.D. The name of Agrippa comes from the place in which the current building 
                                                is built, which was previously occupied by the Pantheon of Agrippa, built in the year 27 
                                                B.C and that was destroyed in a fire in the year 80 A.D.

                                                At the beginning of the 7th century the building was donated to the Pope Boniface IV, who 
                                                transformed it into a church, in which function it currently finds itself in a perfect state

                                                The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: 
                                                the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres. The 
                                                dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's Basilica. At its 
                                                top, a 9 meter diameter opening allows natural light to illuminate the entire building.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The rectangular facade that hides the enormous dome is comprised of 16 granite columns 
                                                which are each 14 meters in height, on which the following inscription can be seen: 
                                                "M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIVM.FECIT", which means "Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built 
                                                this temple when he was a Consul."

                                                of art works are found. The best-known person who can be found buried in the Pantheon 
                                                is without doubt the painter and Renaissance architect Raphael.

                                                The Roman Forum was where religious and public life in ancient Rome took place. 
                                                The Forum is, along with the Colosseum, the greatest sign of the splendor of the 
                                                Roman Empire that can be seen today.
                                                <br><br>
                                                After the fall of the Empire, the Roman Forum was forgotten and little by little 
                                                it was buried under the earth. Although in the 16th century, the existence and 
                                                location of the Forum were already known, it was not until the 20th century that 
                                                excavations were carried out.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Interestingly, the place where the Forum was built was originally a marshy area. 
                                                In the 6th century B.C., the area was drained by means of the Cloaca Maxima, one 
                                                of the first sewer systems in the world.

                                                Besides the great number of temples that are in the forum (Saturn, Venus,

                                                        over Jerusalem. It was built after the death of the emperor Titus.

                                                        size suggests that this was one of the most important buildings of the

                                                Visiting Rome without walking around the Forum is like going to Paris without seeing 
                                                the Eiffel Tower. As you travel along the Via Sacra, close your eyes and imagine it 
                                                as it was more than 20 centuries ago, when Julius Caesar walked there.

                                                and Palatine Hill, skipping the line, and all with an expert guide.

                                                        three-hundred years, until 1878, when it was decorated by Antonio 
                                                        Della Bitta and Gregorio Zappalà.
