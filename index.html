                                        Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they 
                                        believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the city 
                                        of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city center by foot 
                                        surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in 
                                        time to the “glory that was Rome”.

                                        Rome is a city of contrasts. From the Vatican City, the seat of the Roman 
                                        Catholic Church to the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum, 
                                        Rome is a city that is proud of its ancient glorious heritage. The city is 
                                        also proud of its modern and vibrant living with open-air markets, 
                                        stunning artistic fountains, and great food.

                                        Rome is a city of romance, a city of history, and a city of culture. It is 
                                        an enchanting place to visit and is a truly unforgettable city to visit. 
                                        Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and 
                                        Remus — twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war 
                                        god — reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a 
                                        little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are 
                                        absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome.

                                    <h4>Why visit Rome?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        With its unparalleled history, Rome is the third most visited city in Europe 
                                        and the fourteenth worldwide. It attracts visitors from all over the world who 
                                        are impatient to discover the city’s impressive monuments and archaeological 
                                        sites; not to mention its renowned cuisine and its lively atmosphere.

                                        When exploring the Colosseum, visitors will easily imagine how the gladiators 
                                        fought for their lives in the arena, cheered by the crowd. In the Circus Maximus, 
                                        travelers will picture the chariots crashing into each other in order to be first 
                                        in the race, and in the Roman Forum visualize what the Roman public life was like.

                                                    The Colosseum is the main symbol of Rome. It's an imposing construction that,

                                                    The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian
                                                    and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, 
                                                    the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheater, measuring 188 meters in length, 
                                                    156 meters in width, and 57 meters in height.

                                                    During the Roman Empire and under the motto of "Bread and Circuses" the Roman Colosseum 
                                                    (known then as Flavian Amphitheatre) allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles. 
                                                    The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles, and gladiator 
                                                    fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.

                                                    The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated
                                                    in the 6th century.

                                                    Since the 6th century, the Colosseum has suffered lootings, earthquakes, and even bombings during World 
                                                    War Two. Demonstrating a great survival instinct, the Colosseum was used for decades as a storehouse, 
                                                    church, cemetery, and even a castle for nobility.

                                                    The Pantheon of Agrippa, also known as the Roman Pantheon, is one of the architectural 
                                                    masterpieces of the Italian capital. It is the best preserved building from ancient Rome.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The construction of the current Pantheon was carried out during the reign of Hadrian, in 
                                                    the year 126 A.D. The name of Agrippa comes from the place in which the current building 
                                                    is built, which was previously occupied by the Pantheon of Agrippa, built in the year 27 
                                                    B.C and that was destroyed in a fire in the year 80 A.D.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    At the beginning of the 7th century the building was donated to the Pope Boniface IV, who 
                                                    transformed it into a church, in which function it currently finds itself in a perfect state 
                                                    of preservation.

                                                    The most surprising aspect of the architecture in the Pantheon is its measurements: 
                                                    the circular building has exactly the same diameter as its height: 43.5 metres. The 
                                                    dome, which has the same diameter, is bigger than that of St. Peter's Basilica. At its 
                                                    top, a 9 meter diameter opening allows natural light to illuminate the entire building.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The rectangular facade that hides the enormous dome is comprised of 16 granite columns 
                                                    which are each 14 meters in height, on which the following inscription can be seen: 
                                                    "M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIVM.FECIT", which means "Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, built 
                                                    this temple when he was a Consul."

                                                    is without doubt the painter and Renaissance architect Raphael.

                                                    The Roman Forum was where religious and public life in ancient Rome took place. 
                                                    The Forum is, along with the Colosseum, the greatest sign of the splendor of the 
                                                    Roman Empire that can be seen today.

                                                    After the fall of the Empire, the Roman Forum was forgotten and little by little 
                                                    it was buried under the earth. Although in the 16th century, the existence and 
                                                    location of the Forum were already known, it was not until the 20th century that 
                                                    excavations were carried out.

                                                    Interestingly, the place where the Forum was built was originally a marshy area. 
                                                    In the 6th century B.C., the area was drained by means of the Cloaca Maxima, one 
                                                    of the first sewer systems in the world.

                                                    Visiting Rome without walking around the Forum is like going to Paris without seeing 
                                                    the Eiffel Tower. As you travel along the Via Sacra, close your eyes and imagine it 
                                                    as it was more than 20 centuries ago, when Julius Caesar walked there.

                                                    Vatican City (Città del Vaticano in Italian) is an independent city-state located 
                                                    in the heart of Rome, ruled by the Pope (Bishop of Rome). It is the centre of 
                                                    authority over the Roman Catholic Church.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The Vatican is the smallest state in Europe. It has a total area of 0,44 km² and 
                                                    inside its wall live approximately 1000 people.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    In this small state lives the Pope, in the Apostolic palace surrounded by beautiful 
                                                    gardens. The palace is open to the public, but visitors have to book in advance.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The Vatican City was declared independent from the rest of Italy on 11 February 
                                                    1929, with the signing of the Lateran Treaty between Pope Pius XI and Mussolini.

                                                    There are three main attractions in Vatican City: St. Peter’s Square (Piazza San

                                                    The Catacombs of Rome are former underground burial grounds that date 
                                                    from the second to the fifth century and were principally used by 
                                                    Christians and Jews. 
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The catacombs are subterranean passageways that were used as place of 
                                                    burial for a number of centuries. The burials of Jewish, pagan and early 
                                                    Christian Roman citizens in the catacombs began in the second century and 
                                                    ended in the fifth century.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The word catacomb, which means "next to the quarry", comes from the fact 
                                                    that the first excavations to be used as a place of burial were carried 
                                                    out in the outskirts of Rome, next to the site of a quarry.

                                                <h4>The reason for the catacombs</h4>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Christians did not agree with the pagan custom of burning the bodies 
                                                    of their dead, for which reason to solve problems created from a lack of 
                                                    space and the high price of land they decided to create these vast underground 
                                                    cemeteries.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The catacombs possess a huge number of subterranean passageways that form 
                                                    real labyrinths that are several kilometres long, along which rows of 
                                                    rectangular niches were dug out.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The corpses were wrapped in a sheet and placed in the niches, which were 
                                                    then covered with gravestones made of marble or, more commonly, baked 
                                                    clay. Subsequently, the name of the deceased was carved on the cover 
                                                    accompanied by a Christian symbol.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Roman law at the time prohibited the burial of the deceased in the interior 
                                                    of the city, for which reason all of the catacombs were located outside 
                                                    of the walls. These separated and hidden places below ground constituted 
                                                    the perfect refuge in which the Christians could bury their own, freely 
                                                    using Christian symbols.
                                                </p><br>
                                                <h4>The end of persecutions</h4>
                                                <p>
                                                    On signing the Edict of Milan in the year 313, the persecution of Christians 
                                                    ceased, and they could begin to build churches and acquire land without fear 
                                                    of confiscation. In spite of this they continued to use the catacombs as 
                                                    cemeteries until the 5th century.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    During the barbarian invasion of Italy in the 8th century many catacombs 
                                                    suffered continuous lootings, for which reason the Popes caused the still 
                                                    remaining relics to be transferred to the city's churches. After these 
                                                    transfers, some catacombs were abandoned completely and forgotten for centuries.

                                                    The catacombs of Rome offer a very special visit in which the funeral remains 
                                                    of those buried many centuries ago can be seen. It is fascinating to travel 
                                                    through the dark and damp passageways, where you can see, in addition to the 
                                                    niches, some inscriptions with the names of the people that once occupied them.

                                                    Due to the high infant mortality at that time, you can see a large quantity 
                                                    of spaces prepared for these children, alongside some larger graves in which 
                                                    the whole family was buried.

                                                    smallest metro system in Europe. Nevertheless, it reaches the

                                                    Opened in 1955, the metro (subway or underground) in Rome has 
                                                    grown very little by little and currently only operates 37,3 
                                                    miles (60 km) made up of three lines. It is one of the smallest 
                                                    metros in Europe.

                                                    At present, there are plans for the creation of a fourth line. 
                                                    The reason why the metro system is so limited is that each time 
                                                    a new tunnel is built, more archaeological remains are found;

                                                    Rome’s bus routes are possibly the most complex of Europe. The most 
                                                    important information is found on each bus stop.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    This includes the bus’s route, the first and last bus and its timetable. 
                                                    Although this does seem straightforward, once there, having waited 30 
                                                    minutes without seeing one bus drive past, things might seem a littly 
                                                    trickier.

                                                    The good news is that many bus stops now include screens with the number 
                                                    of the bus and when the next is due to arrive.

                                            Rome is a relatively small city and all accommodation located 
                                            between the Tiber River, Termini station, Piazza di Spagna, 
                                            and the Colosseum is a great choice as travelers will be able 
                                            to walk to most of Rome’s top attractions, museums, and monuments.

                                            If you don’t mind spending a little more on accommodation in Rome, 
                                            we recommend looking for lodging near the Trevi Fountain, the 
                                            Piazza Navona, and the Pantheon. Other areas which are also 
                                            very central include Piazza di Spagna, Piazza Barberini, la Via 
                                            del Corso, and its adjacent streets.

                                            If you don’t want to spend too much on lodging, the cheapest hotels 
                                            are found near Termini Railway Station. Furthermore, this area 
                                            is extremely well connected with two of the three metro lines 
                                            stopping at Termini, and the central bus station is situated just

                                            place to visit. In Italy’s capital, you’ll find a wide 
                                            variety of small shops selling traditional products, 
                                            high streets, department stores and top international 
                                            designer boutiques.

                                        <p>
                                            One of the most popular traditional products to buy in Italy 
                                            is pasta. Visitors will find all types of pasta of different 
                                            shapes and sizes, flavour and ingredients throughout the city. 
                                            The best places to buy Italian pasta are in supermarkets or 
                                            specialized shops. The most extravagant variations can cost 
                                            up to € 3 (US$ 3.20) for a 500-gram bag.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Other products that make great presents are: limoncello, olive 
                                            oil or vinegar. If you like parmesan cheese, you can get some 
                                            in Rome, which is normally a lot cheaper and better quality than 
                                            in the rest of Europe or the US.
                                            <br><br>
                                            If you want to spend as little as possible on these souvenirs, 
                                            then the best place to get them is in a supermarket, although 
                                            these are sometimes hard to find in the city.

                                            The Italian love of fashion is well known and the fact is that, 
                                            although it is not Milan, Rome has some of the best designer 
                                            boutiques in Italy.
                                            <br><br>
                                            If you’d like to discover these shops, head to Via del Corso, 
                                            where the most prestigious boutiques are located, or to the 
                                            streets surrounding Piazza di Spagna, especially Via dei Condotti, 
                                            where you’ll find Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari or Armani. 
                                            Then walk to Via Veneto, where there are other stores of the 
                                            same standard.
                                            <br><br>
                                            If you’re looking for counterfeit products, especially bags, 
                                            you’ll be surprised at how many people sell these on the 
                                            popular streets of Rome. It is possible to purchase a Gucci 
                                            replica bag for € 10 (US$ 10.80).

                                        <p>
                                            Via del Babuino, connecting Piazza di Spagna to Piazza del 
                                            Popolo, is famous for its antique and art shops. Via Margutta, 
                                            which runs parallel to Via del Babuino, is also worth visiting.

                                        <h4>Souvenirs and gifts</h4>

                                            Souvenir shops and street stalls are found in Rome’s most important 
                                            tourist spots. If you are good at bargaining, you will be able to 
                                            get the typical figurines and other souvenirs for great prices.

                                            Unlike most capital cities in Europe, Rome does not have many 
                                            department stores. The closest to the city centre is the Galleria 
                                            Alberto Sordi, on Via del Corso, near the Piazza Colonna. It
