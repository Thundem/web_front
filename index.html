            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>
                Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they 
                believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the city 
                of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city center by foot 
                surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in 
                time to the “glory that was Rome”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rome is a city of contrasts. From the Vatican City, the seat of the Roman 
                Catholic Church to the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum, 
                Rome is a city that is proud of its ancient glorious heritage. The city is 
                also proud of its modern and vibrant living with open-air markets, 
                stunning artistic fountains, and great food.
            </p>

                Rome is a city of romance, a city of history, and a city of culture. It is 
                an enchanting place to visit and is a truly unforgettable city to visit. 
                Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and 
                Remus — twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war 
                god — reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a 
                little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are 
                absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome.

                                                The Colosseum is the main symbol of Rome. It's an imposing construction that, 
                                                with almost 2,000 years of history, will bring you back in time to discover the
                                                way of life in the Roman Empire.

                                                The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian
                                                and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, 
                                                the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheater, measuring 188 meters in length, 
                                                156 meters in width, and 57 meters in height.

                                                During the Roman Empire and under the motto of "Bread and Circuses" the Roman Colosseum 
                                                (known then as Flavian Amphitheatre) allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles. 
                                                The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles, and gladiator 
                                                fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated
                                                in the 6th century.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Since the 6th century, the Colosseum has suffered lootings, earthquakes, and even bombings during World 
                                                War Two. Demonstrating a great survival instinct, the Colosseum was used for decades as a storehouse, 
                                                church, cemetery, and even a castle for nobility.

                                                    lives of more than 2,000 gladiators.
