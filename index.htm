            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>
                Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they 
                believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the city 
                of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city center by foot 
                surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in 
                time to the “glory that was Rome”.

                Rome is a city of contrasts. From the Vatican City, the seat of the Roman 
                Catholic Church to the ancient ruins of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum, 
                Rome is a city that is proud of its ancient glorious heritage. The city is 
                also proud of its modern and vibrant living with open-air markets, 
                stunning artistic fountains, and great food.

                Rome is a city of romance, a city of history, and a city of culture. It is 
                an enchanting place to visit and is a truly unforgettable city to visit. 
                Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and 
                Remus — twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war 
                god — reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a 
                little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are 
                absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome.
