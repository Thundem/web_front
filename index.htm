            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>
                Rome, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province), of Lazio regione (region), 
                and of the country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, 
                on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of 
                an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity 
                and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman 
                Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome 
                is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to 
                the creative imagination of the past. Area city, 496 square miles (1,285 square km); province, 
                2,066 square miles (5,352 square km). Pop. (2011) city, 2,617,175; province, 3,997,465; (2022 est.) 
                city, 2,761,632; province, 4,222,631.
